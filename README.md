# Implementation of a 3-dimensional Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Model

This model was originally intended to give an explanation why lots of large systems in nature display powerlaw distributions phenomena. The BTW model is very simple and reproduces powerlaw distributions within the bulk region of its implementation as it can be seen on the screenshot below. Inevitable size effects appear at the extremities of the distribution. This is due to the borders of the volume sample.
